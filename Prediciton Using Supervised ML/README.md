## Objective of the task
The person will study for 9.5 hours per day and the supervised Machine Learning will predict a mark which he score
### Conclusion
* The person can be able to get 92.90 score once he studies for 9.25 hours per day.
* The r2 score is evaluated and the score is 95% which seems to be a better model.
* The above plot has alomost a straight line which represent that the model is quite good enough in predicting the data based on the given dataset.
